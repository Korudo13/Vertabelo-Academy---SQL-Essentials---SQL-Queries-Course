SELECT
c.id AS cus_id,
c.name AS cus_name,
MAX(pi.purchase_id) AS latest_purchase_id, 	-- purchase_id listed chronologically, so MAX is most recent
SUM(pi.quantity) AS all_items_purchased

FROM customer c

-- connecting customer IDs to their purchases.
JOIN purchase p
ON c.id = p.customer_id

-- connecting customer purchases to purchase details
JOIN purchase_item pi
ON p.id = pi.purchase_id

-- only 3 customers, so grouping by their customer's IDs
GROUP BY c.id
