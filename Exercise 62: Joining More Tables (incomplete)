The challenge is as follows: for each room with 2 beds where there actually are 2 students, 
we want to show one row which contains the following columns:

    the name of the first student,
    the name of the second student and
    the room number.

Don't change any column names. Each pair of students should only be shown once. 
The student whose name comes first in the alphabet should be shown first.

A small hint: in terms of SQL, "first in the alphabet" means "smaller than" for text values.

SELECT
s1.name,
s2.name,
r.room_number

FROM student s1

--joining students for 2nd student
JOIN student s2
ON s1.room_id = s2.room_id

-- joining room for room_number
JOIN room r
ON s1.room_id = r.id

-- shows name that comes first in alphabetical order
WHERE s1.name < s2.name 

-- ensuring there are 2 beds for the 2 students only
AND beds = 2
