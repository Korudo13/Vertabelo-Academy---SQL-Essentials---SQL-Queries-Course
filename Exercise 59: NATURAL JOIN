Use NATURAL JOIN on the tables student and room.

----------
Code
-----------

SELECT * 
FROM student

NATURAL JOIN room

/* This is an implicit JOIN that lets SQL decide how to join the tables. This is convenient, but probably isn't the best way to do it. 
It always joins columns that have the same exact name, so it wouldn't work for "id" and "room_id". They'd have to both be "room_id". 

It could cause a problem to join "student.id" and "room.id", since they are syntactically the same, but the meanings are different. */
