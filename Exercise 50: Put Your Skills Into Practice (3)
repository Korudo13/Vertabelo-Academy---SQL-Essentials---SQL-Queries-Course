SELECT
LAST_NAME,
FIRST_NAME,
AVG(SALARY) AS AVERAGE_SALARY,
COUNT(*) AS YEARS_WORKED

FROM employees

GROUP BY LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
ORDER BY AVERAGE_SALARY DESC

/* In this case: I use "HAVING" because I want to return the columns after the calculations have been done, then limit the aggregated rows. 
Using a "WHERE" clause would have limited rows before the calculations. */
