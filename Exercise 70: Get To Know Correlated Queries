Let's check if the database contains any errors in another way.

Find all information about each country whose population is equal to 
or smaller than the population of the least populated city in that specific country.

----------
Code
-----------

SELECT *
FROM country

-- compares country population to smallest city population, where the city's country_id matches the country's id
WHERE population <= 
					(SELECT MIN(population) 
					 FROM city 
					 WHERE city.country_id = country.id);


-- result returns zero rows, so no errors. No country's population should be smaller than the smallest city's population.
